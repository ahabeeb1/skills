# Changelog

All notable changes to `habeebs-skill`.

## Convention

Every entry includes a **Why** line — the reason the feature exists, not just what it is. This is so future readers (humans and agents) can judge whether a feature is still load-bearing, or has been outgrown.

Versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** — breaking change to a skill's frontmatter, output template, or handoff contract
- **MINOR** — new skill, new phase, new template, or new opt-in behavior
- **PATCH** — wording fixes, internal cleanups, doc clarifications

Each release gets a git tag `vX.Y.Z` and a GitHub release with notes mirrored from this file.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`prior-art-research` Phase 0 — Reconnaissance.** A pre-question pass that probes manifests (package.json, schema files, Dockerfile, CI config, recent git activity) and writes/loads `docs/agents/SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md`. Subsequent chain skills (`draft-spec`, `socratic-grill`, `decision-record`) inherit the cache for free.
  - **Why:** Phase 1 was asking the user for things `package.json` already said. Cold-asking is both rude and weak — the user only tells you what they remember. Phase 0 forces the discipline of *looking first*, and the in-repo cache file makes the reconnaissance reusable across chain runs without introducing a vector store or MCP dependency. Decided against `claude-mem` / `graphify` integration because in-repo markdown is versioned, reviewable, and human-correctable; opaque vector stores aren't.
  - New reference: `skills/prior-art-research/references/recon-checklist.md`
  - New reference: `skills/prior-art-research/references/system-context-template.md`
  - Staleness detection via `git log --since "<file_mtime>" -- <manifest_paths>`; user-confirmed refresh, never silent overwrite.

- **`parallel-dev` — Mandatory commit discipline for artifact-producing subagents.** Each subagent that writes to the repo now commits its own work with a structured commit message containing `Dispatched-by`, `Dispatch-id`, `Subagent`, and `Parent-task` trailers. Dispatcher captures returned SHAs in the dispatch record.
  - **Why:** v1.0.0 captured timing and tokens but not commit SHAs, which meant a parallel run was not replayable from `git log` alone. Subagents returning text blobs the parent had to interpret-and-write was lossy and broke `git blame`. Forcing per-subagent commits gives full audit trail (`git log --grep="Dispatch-id: <id>"`) and lets partial successes survive a re-dispatch without rework. Research subagents that return structured records (not files) remain exempt — the parent commits the synthesized output once.

### Changed

- **`prior-art-research` Phase 1 reframed from cold-asking to gap-filling.** Where v1.0 led with five generic context questions, v1.1 leads with: *"I see X, Y, Z; two open questions remain: A and B."* Phase 0's recon output drives this.
  - **Why:** Same root cause as the Phase 0 addition. The new framing is materially cheaper for the user (fewer questions) AND higher-signal (questions are scoped to genuine unknowns).

### Plugin metadata

- `version`: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

### Dogfood test

- `tests/dogfood/05-research-recon-and-memory.md` — the chain run on the meta-question that drove this release. Demonstrates Phase 0's value by example.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-10

First stable release. All 10 skills fully fleshed out, all 4 phases tested.

### Skills (10 total)

**Research chain (Phase 1-2):**
- `prior-art-research` — convergent research; finds production patterns
- `using-habeebs-skill` — chain intro
- `draft-spec` — recommendation → vertical-slice implementation spec
- `socratic-grill` — drives ambiguity out across 7 axes
- `decision-record` — locks chosen architecture as ADR

**Engineering primitives (Phase 3):**
- `tdd-loop` — red-green-refactor per vertical slice
- `deep-modules` — Ousterhout deletion test for refactoring
- `parallel-dev` — independence-verified parallel subagent dispatch
- `vertical-slice` — tracer-bullet decomposition with HITL/AFK labels

**Meta (Phase 4):**
- `setup-habeebs-skill` — per-repo bootstrap of issue tracker + labels + domain doc layout

### Commands

`/research`, `/spec`, `/grill`, `/record`, `/tdd`, `/deepen`, `/parallel`, `/slice`, `/groundwork`

### Agent prompts

`source-fetcher`, `pattern-extractor`, `synthesizer` — used by `prior-art-research` Deep mode through `parallel-dev`

### Test results

- Phase 1 (prior-art-research): 15/15 = 100%
- Phase 2 (chain: spec → grill → record): 29/29 = 100%
- Phase 3 (engineering primitives): 32/32 = 100%
- Phase 4 (setup): 7/7 = 100%
- **Cumulative: 83/83 = 100% across 12 test scenarios**

### Inspirations

- [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) — methodology framing, TDD loop, subagent-driven dev
- [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/yeachan-heo/oh-my-claudecode) — plugin structure, orchestration primitives
- [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) — vertical slices (to-issues), deep-modules, setup pattern, ambiguity-grill philosophy
- [Ousterhout, *A Philosophy of Software Design*](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201) — deep modules, deletion test, strategic vs tactical

### Known limitations

- Test results are self-tests (same Claude instance wrote skills and outputs). Real-world validation requires installing in Claude Code and running against actual codebases.
- The Deep mode of `prior-art-research` relies on subagent runtime — verify your Claude Code version supports parallel subagent dispatch.
- Source-tiers.md will drift over time; needs periodic refresh.
