# habeebs-skill

**Research-grounded engineering methodology, packaged as an installable agent-skill bundle.**

Before you build X, find how the best teams actually shipped X. Then spec it, grill it, capture the decisions, and implement it with TDD, vertical slices, and deep modules.

Works as:
- a **Claude Code plugin** (installable via `/plugin marketplace add ...`)
- a **Codex CLI** (or generic agent) skill bundle, by vendoring this repo and referencing `AGENTS.md`

Complements (does not replace) [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/yeachan-heo/oh-my-claudecode), [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7), and [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills).

## What it does

A skill chain that grounds implementation in real production patterns rather than generic best-practices.

```
prior-art-research → draft-spec → socratic-grill → decision-record → tdd-loop
                                                 ↓
                                         parallel-dev + deep-modules + vertical-slice
                                         (supporting primitives)
```

## Repository scaffolding

This repo is the plugin itself — there is no separate "source" tree. The whole repo is the deliverable.

### Anatomy of a skill

Every skill lives in `skills/<name>/` and follows the same contract:

- **`SKILL.md`** — required. Starts with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) that the agent matches against when deciding whether to trigger. The body is the procedure the agent should execute.
- **`references/`** — optional. Templates, checklists, and reference material the `SKILL.md` cites by relative path. Loaded on demand so the main `SKILL.md` stays short.

The frontmatter `description` is the single most important field — keep it specific about when to trigger AND when not to.

### Anatomy of a slash command

Files under `commands/<verb>.md` are Claude Code slash commands. They are thin wrappers that delegate to a skill — they exist so users can type `/research` instead of "use the prior-art-research skill." Codex users invoke the skill by name directly.

### Anatomy of a subagent

Files under `agents/<role>.md` are subagent prompts with their own frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`). They are dispatched in parallel by the host skill (currently only `prior-art-research` in Deep mode uses them) and return a structured record.

## The skills

### Core research → spec → grill → record chain

| Skill | What it does | When it fires |
|---|---|---|
| `prior-art-research` | Finds 3-5 production implementations of approximately-X, extracts patterns, recommends an approach | User wants to build/implement/design any non-trivial feature |
| `draft-spec` | Turns the research recommendation into an implementation spec | After `prior-art-research` completes |
| `socratic-grill` | Drives ambiguity out of every decision through structured questioning | When a spec has open questions or implicit assumptions |
| `decision-record` | Captures chosen architecture as an ADR for future reference | After spec + grill, before implementation |

### Engineering primitives

| Skill | What it does | Inspired by |
|---|---|---|
| `tdd-loop` | Red-green-refactor TDD with vertical slices + two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality) | Superpowers + mattpocock |
| `deep-modules` | Ousterhout deep module check — find shallow modules, propose deepenings | mattpocock |
| `parallel-dev` | Dispatches parallel subagents into isolated worktrees, with per-subagent commit discipline | Superpowers + OMC |
| `vertical-slice` | Decomposes work into tracer-bullet vertical slices (HITL vs AFK) | mattpocock |
| `using-worktrees` | Isolates each feature/AFK slice in its own git worktree with verified-clean baseline; teardown via finishing-a-development-branch | Superpowers |
| `systematic-debugging` | Reproduce → minimize → hypothesis-driven probe → fix → regression test → postmortem | Superpowers + OMC trace |

### Meta

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `setup-habeebs-skill` | One-time per-repo bootstrap — issue tracker, label vocab, domain doc layout |
| `using-habeebs-skill` | Intro skill so the agent knows the chain exists |

## Installation

### Claude Code — via marketplace (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ahabeeb1/skills
/plugin install habeebs-skill@habeebs-skill
```

### Claude Code — local dev

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahabeeb1/skills.git
cd skills
claude --plugin-dir .
```

### Codex CLI (or any AGENTS.md-aware agent)

Codex does not have a plugin manager; vendor the repo instead:

```bash
# from your project root
git submodule add https://github.com/ahabeeb1/skills.git vendor/habeebs-skill
```

Then reference it from your project's root `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Skills

This project uses [habeebs-skill](./vendor/habeebs-skill/AGENTS.md).
See `vendor/habeebs-skill/skills/` for the skill bundle.
```

Codex will read the vendored `SKILL.md` files on demand. Invoke a skill by name:

```
> Use the prior-art-research skill to investigate event-sourced order systems.
```

---

## Quick start

After install, just describe what you want to build:

```
> I want to build a real-time collaborative document editor for my SaaS.
```

The chain fires automatically: research → spec → grill → record → implementation primitives.

To invoke a single step (Claude Code):

```
/research "real-time collaborative editor"
/spec     # after research
/grill    # after spec
/record   # after grill
```

To invoke a single step (Codex or any agent):

```
> Run the prior-art-research skill on "real-time collaborative editor".
> Now run draft-spec on that recommendation.
> Now run socratic-grill on the spec.
> Now run decision-record on the grilled spec.
```

## Status

**v1.0.0 — All 4 phases complete.** All 10 skills fully fleshed out.

- prior-art-research, using-habeebs-skill (Phase 1)
- draft-spec, socratic-grill, decision-record (Phase 2)
- tdd-loop, deep-modules, parallel-dev, vertical-slice (Phase 3)
- setup-habeebs-skill (Phase 4)

**Eval results: 83/83 = 100%** across 12 test scenarios. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Contributing

The skill format is simple — a directory under `skills/` with `SKILL.md` and an optional `references/` folder. To add a skill:

1. Create `skills/<your-skill>/SKILL.md` with a precise frontmatter `description`.
2. Add a slash-command shortcut at `commands/<verb>.md` if you want a `/your-skill` alias.
3. Add evals under `tests/evals/` covering trigger conditions.
4. Bump version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
